# What is an ORM ? Why and When should I use it?

In Computer Science, an ORM means an "Object-relational mapping". An ORM  is supposed to convert data between incompatible type systems using object-oriented programming languages. From that point, an "object" representing the database will be created and used with same the programming language of the framework or development environment. The main goal is indeed to interact with any database without embedding SQL queries.
